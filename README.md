Great device, get one.

Documentation is... patchy... lets call it that ;) It doesn't appear to have been updated since first release 2 years ago and is missing everything new they've added (which is a lot!).
You're pointed at the repo to read the source to find additions etc... except that was last updated 2 years ago. Looks like they develop in-house and then completely forgot to push anything up to GitHub for 2 years!

So this is a simple repo of the 2.1.4 version installed on my machine so I look at it on machines without Z-Uno installed or in a browser instead of screaming at the filesystem...

You're probably here for https://github.com/Wismgari/Z-Uno-2.1.4/blob/master/cores/zuno/ZUNO_Definitions.h ;)
